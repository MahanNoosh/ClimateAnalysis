# ClimateAnalysis üåç

Java-based program for analyzing daily climate data.  
It processes a CSV dataset of weather measurements, computes statistics such as maximum, minimum, and average temperatures, largest daily temperature changes, and maximum wind speed.  
It can also generate a CSV file with moving averages of daily temperatures.

## Features
- Load and process climate data from `data.csv`  
- Compute maximum and minimum daily temperatures  
- Compute average daily temperature per year  
- Find largest daily increase and decrease in temperature  
- Compute maximum daily wind speed  
- Generate CSV of daily moving averages for average temperature
